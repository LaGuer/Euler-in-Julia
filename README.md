Problems from [Project Euler](http://projecteuler.net/), solved using the [Julia language](http://julialang.org/). 

Some problems have an easy solution when using Julia's inbuilt functions or its standard library or external packages. Most of the time, these easy (at times trivial) solutions are faster and more memory efficient, and *should* be used in anything resembling production usage. Since the point here is to learn the language and to understand the problems though, the solutions actually executed here are longer, more roundabout solutions, with the easy ways mentioned in comments in the program. 

These are written for Julia 0.6.0.
